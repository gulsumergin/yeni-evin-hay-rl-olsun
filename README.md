📄 Project Description – New Home Gift Selector
Category: Frontend Web Development & Interactive UI
Duration: Personal Project
Team Size: Individual
My Role: Frontend Developer & Content Creator

Problem:
- Wanted to create a humorous, interactive web page for congratulating someone on their new home, offering a playful way to “choose” a gift.

Solution:
- Developed a two-page interactive web app where users can select from three funny fictional gifts — a self-cleaning carpet, a silent neighbor set, or a never-ending coffee mug. The selection is stored locally and displayed on the second page with a personalized humorous message and a roommate-related joke. Users can also send their own “dream gift” via an email form.

Impact:
- Provided a fun and creative way to celebrate a new home online.
- Combined humor with interactive design to increase user engagement.
- Added personalization through gift-specific jokes and custom gift suggestions.

Key Contributions:
- Built HTML structure for gift selection and result display pages.
- Styled with CSS for a clean, card-based design.
- Used JavaScript localStorage to transfer the chosen gift between pages.
- Created dynamic text generation for humorous gift messages.
- Implemented an email form for custom gift requests.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, localStorage API)
  
Outcome:
- Delivered a lighthearted, shareable interactive experience.
- Practiced skills in state persistence between pages and dynamic content rendering.
